# Edu Robotics Cup Masters 2024-2025 â€“ Summary

## Overview

The 2024-2025 "Engineer Challenge - Masters" is a **Rescue Mission** where teams have 2 minutes to complete a series of tasks to assist stranded astronauts. The mission requires creativity and technical skills to build tools and strategies for a successful rescue operation, supporting a ground unit's preparation.

## Game Field and Objects

The game is played on a designated mat. The game objects include:

- **Lego mini figures:** 4 standard-sized figures (head, body, legs only)
- **Lego Spaceship parts:** 38 bricks of size 2x4 and 4 bricks of size 2x2
- **External Fuel Tank, Solid Fuel Booster Rocket, and Orbiter**
- **Soda can:** 1 standard-sized can with a 58 mm base diameter
- **Plastic bottle caps:** 3 blue and 3 of any other color
- **Ruler:** 1 ruler of 30 cm

Objects must be placed correctly at the start; otherwise, points for that object are not awarded. When placing an object on an area, the bordering lines are not considered part of the area.

## Tasks

1. **Build a Spaceship**  
   Move the External Fuel Tank, Solid Fuel Booster Rocket, and Orbiter to touch the "Spaceship" graphic or the white-black line area.

2. **Cargo**  
   All cargo elements (Water, Air, Food) must touch the blue-lined area in the top right corner (including the spacecraft and adjacent black-white line).

3. **The Crew**  
   Astronaut crew must be touching the blue-lined "farm area" in the bottom right corner (the black-white line is not part of the area).

4. **Parking**
